 \\nYou simply couldn\'t!\\n\\nHaving inputs to reverse the logic to only process by using inclusive criteria was not something possible so far.\\n\\n## What is new? {#what-is-new}\\n\\nTo tackle this issue and be able to only process issues that belongs to a specific project or to a specific list of projects, we needed a new input.  \\nSo, the input [issue-only-any-project-cards](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-only-any-project-cards-input) was created for this purpose.\\n\\n## Why is that so important? {#why-is-that-so-important}\\n\\nDeveloping those features are not that hard, but thinking about how to combine them all together in a way that makes sense is a bit more difficult.  \\nBut now we have a recipe to _inclusive inputs_, and we will be able to provide more functionalities following the same scheme! :rocket:\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nYou can see an [advanced example](../docs/examples/multiple-cron-example) to configure different workflows with multiple cron that may help you fine-tune even more the action.\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/Sonia-corporation/stale/tree/develop/documentation/blog/2022-01-20-first-website-draft/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-20-first-website-draft/index.mdx","title":"Welcome!","description":"Welcome to the very first version of the Website!\\n","date":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"20 janvier 2022","tags":[{"label":"stale","permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/tags/stale"},{"label":"website","permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/tags/website"},{"label":"documentation","permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/tags/documentation"},{"label":"first draft","permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/tags/first-draft"}],"readingTime":0.575,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey \\"C0ZEN\\" Testelin","title":"Cr\xe9ateur et mainteneur de cette action GitHub Stale","url":"https://github.com/C0ZEN","imageURL":"https://github.com/C0ZEN.png","key":"C0ZEN"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome!","description":"Welcome to the very first version of the Website!\\n","authors":["C0ZEN"],"tags":["stale","website","documentation","first draft"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"The first inclusive filter input is here!","permalink":"/stale/fr/blog/first-inclusive-input"}},"content":"Happy to announce that this is the very first version of this website!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why even bother?
