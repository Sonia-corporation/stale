way faster for us to create a new release, because the documentation creation will be completely asynchronous.\\n\\nOn top of that, [Vercel](https://vercel.com) has many more features that we will also discover/configure later on.  \\nWe also added [Sentry](https://sentry.io) as part of the documentation to track eventual errors that you may come across.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nEven if we changed in

only inputs available to ignore the processing of issues for a project were the [issue-ignore-all-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-ignore-all-projects-input) and the [issue-ignore-any-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-ignore-any-projects-input) inputs.  \\nBut what if you only wish to process issues that belongs to a specific project?  \\nYou simply

able to only process issues that belongs to a specific project or to a specific list of projects, we needed a new input.  \\nSo, the input [issue-only-any-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-only-any-projects-input) was created for this purpose.\\n\\n## Why is that so important? {#why-is-that-so-important}\\n\\nDeveloping those features are not that hard, but thinking about how to combine them all together in a way that makes sense is a bit more difficult.  \\nBut now we have a recipe to _inclusive inputs_, and we will be able to provide more functionalities following the same scheme! :rocket:\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nYou can see an [advanced example](../docs/examples/multiple-cron-example) to configure different workflows
