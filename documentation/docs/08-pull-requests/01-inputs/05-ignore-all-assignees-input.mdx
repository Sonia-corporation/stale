### Input {#input}

Name: `pull-request-ignore-all-assignees`  
Type: `boolean`  
Default value: `false`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you ignore the processing of the pull requests which have at least one assignee.  
This can be useful when you use assignees to assign the pull requests to the members of your repository which will for sure close or at least process the pull requests very soon.

However, if you are not certain that every assignee will handle for sure the processing of the pull requests, this input may not suit you.  
You may prefer to use instead the [ignore any assignees input](pull-request-ignore-any-assignees-input) to list only some specific assignees or not use this input at all.

### Example {#example}

```yml {6}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  pull-request-ignore-all-assignees: true
```
