### Input {#input}

Name: `pull-request-days-before-close`  
Type: `number`  
Default value: `30`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you define the number of days before processing the pull requests to close.

The number of days is calculated based on the stale date (the stale label creation date) from today.

The pull request will be closed tomorrow if no update occur until then.

add labels onto it by using the [add labels after close input](pull-request-add-labels-after-close-input)
and add a comment to explain why it was closed by using the [close comment input](pull-request-close-comment-input).
