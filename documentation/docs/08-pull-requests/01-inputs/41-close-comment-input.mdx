### Input {#input}

Name: `pull-request-close-comment`  
Type: `string`  
Default value: `''`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you define the comment that will be added on the pull requests when they are closed after being stale for too long during the processing.  
This can be useful if you wish to improve the communication and the process on how to handle an unwanted closed pull request.

:::note

You can also add labels onto it by using the [add labels after close input](pull-request-add-labels-after-close-input)
and define the number of days before closing it by using the [days before close input](pull-request-days-before-close-input).

### Example {#example}

```yml {6-7}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  pull-request-close-comment: |
    This pull request is now closed due to a lack of activity!
```
