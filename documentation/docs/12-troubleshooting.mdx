You can find here small tips and known issues/frequently asked questions that may help you to get through this action.

## How do I test without altering my repository?

You can use the [dry-run](dry-run-input) input to `true`.  
The workflow will work normally, but each time a mutation should occur, it will simply omit it.

You can also limit the quantity of mutations by using the [issue-limit-api-mutations-count](issues/inputs/issue-limit-api-mutations-count-input) and the [pull-request-limit-api-mutations-count](pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-limit-api-mutations-count-input) inputs.

Lastly, you could only start to process your issues and pull requests from a specific date with the [issue-ignore-before-creation-date](issues/inputs/issue-ignore-before-creation-date-input) and the [pull-request-ignore-before-creation-date](pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-ignore-before-creation-date-input) inputs.

## How do I see all the logs?

Enable the debug mode for the actions by adding the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` GitHub secret to `true` in your repository.  
Follow this [documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-debugging.md#how-to-access-step-debug-logs) if you need more details.

## The logs indicate that my issue or pull request has missing data

Make sure to use the proper [GitHub token](github-token-input), and that it has all the required [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/permissions-required-for-github-apps) to be able to fetch all the information.  
See the [original discussion](https://github.com/Sonia-corporation/stale/issues/498) to have more information.
