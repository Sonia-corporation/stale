## Know your workflow with the help of statistics {#know-your-workflow-with-the-help-of-statistics}

To have an oversight vision of your workflow, you can check out the logs.  
There is, at the end, a list of statistics listing the main events that occurred during the run.

### Dry-run mode {#dry-run-mode}

This feature can be very helpful when you are not sure how the workflow will behave based on your configuration.  
In such case, enable the [dry-run mode](dry-run-input) to avoid altering your repository, execute the workflow, and then analyse the statistics.

### Limited API calls {#limited-api-calls}

You can also simply limit the number of API queries calls for your [issues](issues/inputs/issue-limit-api-queries-count-input) and [pull requests](pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-limit-api-queries-count-input), and a limit of API mutations calls for your [issues](issues/inputs/issue-limit-api-mutations-count-input) and [pull requests](pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-limit-api-mutations-count-input) to alter your repository on a reduced scope.
