## Stale all issues with comments except if somebody is assigned {#stale-all-issues-with-comments-except-if-somebody-is-assigned}

### Description

The label `Ã¬nactive` will be added on all issues without any activity during the last 45 days, except if someone is assigned to it or if this is either a frozen bug, a bug that need help or a confirmed bug.  
A comment will also be added to warn the people about this.  
If there is still no activity after two weeks, the issue will be closed and the `closed-due-to-inactivity` label will be added.

### Example

```yml
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-stale-label: inactive
  issue-ignore-any-labels: |
    frozen :ice_cube:
    need help
    bug-confirmed
  issue-ignore-all-assignees: true
  issue-days-before-stale: 45
  issue-stale-comment: |
    This issue is inactive since 45 days!

    If there is no activity, it will be closed in two weeks.
  issue-days-before-close: 14
  issue-add-labels-after-close: |
    closed-due-to-inactivity
```
