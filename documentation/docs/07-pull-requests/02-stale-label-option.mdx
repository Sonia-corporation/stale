### Input {#input}

Name: `pull-request-stale-label`  
Type: `string`  
Default value: `stale`

### Description {#description}

This option will let you define the label (by name) that will be added to your pull requests when they are considered as stale.

If the label is added to a pull request (based on the [days before stale option](pull-request-days-before-stale-option)), the next time the pull request is processed, the workflow will process it as a candidate for un-stale.  
If the pull request was updated after the addition of the label, the pull request will be un-stale, and the label will be removed.

Once the un-stale processing is done, if the pull request is still stale, the workflow will then process it as a candidate for closing.  
If the pull request is stale for too long (based on the [days before close option](pull-request-days-before-close-option)), the pull request will be closed.

:::caution

The label must be a real label, existing inside your repository list of labels (_github.com/your-organization/your-repository/labels_).  
If not, the GitHub API will throw an error.

:::tip

You may find useful to [convert your pull requests to draft](pull-request-to-draft-instead-of-stale-option) instead of stale.
