### Input {#input}

Name: `dry-run`  
Type: `boolean`  
Default value: `false`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you run the stale workflow without performing any kind of Data Manipulation Language.  
Your issues and pull requests will be safe, no label nor comment will be added, nothing will be closed.

This is a good way to experiment with your configuration so that you won't have any surprises.

:::tip

The logs will give you a lot of information to know what is happening during the processing.  
Check also the [statistics](statistics) at the end of the logs to have an overhaul idea of what happened.

### Fast configuration testing {#fast-configuration-testing}

By using this input in association with a [manually triggered workflow](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/), it's very convenient and fast to test your configuration.

```yml {2-3}
name: Stale
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
# ...
```

### Example {#example}

```yml {6}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  dry-run: true
```
