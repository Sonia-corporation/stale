# Introduction

## Why?

This project aim to provide a GitHub action to help the maintainers of GitHub repositories to tackle and manage their open issues and pull requests which are inactive.  
The most basic example would be to automatically close inactive items after some days.  
But this action provide way more options to customize how you wish to "flag" or manage an inactive item - we use the word **stale** to define this state.

## Issues

You can refer to the [documentation](issues/all-issues-options).

## Pull requests

## One more stale action...

This is not the first and maybe not the last project that aim to solve this stale issue on GitHub.  
This action was created to simply replace - at least in terms of features- the [action created by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/stale) to stale.  
[Geoffrey 'C0ZEN' Testelin](https://github.com/C0ZEN) was originally one of the main contributor of this action, but due to different visions, he decided to go on his own to create this action instead.  
Our goal is to provide as many features as people need to make sure they can reduce the complexity of managing those stale items impediments.
