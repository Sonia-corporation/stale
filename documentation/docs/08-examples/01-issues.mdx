## Stale all issues with comments except if somebody is assigned {#stale-all-issues-with-comments-except-if-somebody-is-assigned}

The label `Ã¬nactive` will be added on all issues without any activity during the last 45 days, except if someone is assigned to it or if this is either a frozen bug, a bug that need help or a confirmed bug.  
A comment will also be added to warn the people about this.  
If there is still no activity after two weeks, the issue will be closed and the `closed-due-to-inactivity` label will be added.
