The first step to start with this stale action is to create your GitHub workflow.

## Create the workflow file {#create-the-workflow-file}

On your repository, create a new workflow inside the _.github/workflows_ folder.  
For example: _stale.yml_.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ .github
    â””â”€â”€ workflows
        â””â”€â”€ stale.yml
```

## Create the default stale action {#create-the-default-stale-action}

Now you can create the stale action with the [default configuration](../introduction#default-configuration).

```yml title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
name: Stale
jobs:
  Stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run stale
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Stale
        id: stale
        # We suggest replacing "latest" with the latest major tag like "sonia-corporation/stale@1"
        # This will avoid in the future a risk to break your workflow when a new major (breaking change) occur or worst, by altering your items in a way that doesn't suit you
        uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
```

:::caution

Make sure to acknowledge the comment regarding the `latest` tag, this is for our own good ðŸ˜‰

## Configure how to trigger your workflow {#configure-how-to-trigger-your-workflow}

From the [previous step configuration](#create-the-default-stale-action), your workflow will work but will never be triggered.  
You must define how/when you wish to run the stale action.

For most repositories, running the action on daily basis and allowing it also to be [run manually](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) is a good choice.

```yml {2-8} title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
name: Stale
on:
  # Allow to run it manually on GitHub (a button will be visible)
  # See https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Schedule a cron job to be run each day at noon
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'
jobs:
  # ...
```
