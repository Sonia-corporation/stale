## Test the workflow {#test-the-workflow}

At this point, you shall have a working stale action.  
Before going further into the customization, you may want to try it first.

:::tip

Use the [dry-run](../dry-run-input) mode to avoid altering your repository yet.

:::

```yml {5-6} title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  dry-run: true
```

:::tip

You can now check the logs, and especially the [statistics](../statistics) at the end.  
You will have a better idea over what to expect when a real run without the [dry-run](../dry-run-input) mode occur.

:::

## Customize the behaviour {#customize-the-behaviour}

If the action was successful, you may wish now to configure it at your convenience.  
Follow the [next page](../all-inputs) to have access to all the inputs.

:::info

The stale processing can be completely different between issues and pull requests.
