## Test the workflow

At this point, you shall have a working stale action.  
Before going further into the customization, you may want to try it first.

:::tip

Use the `dry-run` mode to avoid altering your repository yet.

:::

```yml {5-6} title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  dry-run: true
```

:::tip

You can now check the logs, and especially the statistics at the end.  
You will have a better idea over what to expect when a real run without the `dry-run` mode occur.

:::

## Customize the behaviour

If the action was successful, you may wish now to configure it at your convenience.  
Follow the next page to know how.

:::info

The stale processing can be completely different between issues and pull requests.
