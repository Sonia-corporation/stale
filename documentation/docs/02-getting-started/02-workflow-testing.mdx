  Explanation to test a newly configured stale workflow so that it's safer for your project. 
  The action can be risky if wrongly configured and may close all your issues for example.
  The dry-run option is strongly suggested, but also the limit of operations.

## Test the workflow {#test-the-workflow}

At this point, you shall have a working stale action.  
Before going further into the customization, you may want to try it first.

### Test it with the dry-run mode {#test-it-with-the-dry-run-mode}

Use the [dry-run](../dry-run-input) mode to avoid altering your repository yet.

```yml {5-6} title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  dry-run: true
```

:::tip

You can now check the logs, and especially the [statistics](../statistics) at the end.  
You will have a better idea over what to expect when a real run without the [dry-run](../dry-run-input) mode occur.

:::

### Test it with a limited amount of API calls {#test-it-with-a-limited-amount-of-api-calls}

If you still wish to play it safe, you can configure a limit of API queries calls for your [issues](../issues/inputs/issue-limit-api-queries-count-input) and [pull requests](../pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-limit-api-queries-count-input), and a limit of API mutations calls for your [issues](../issues/inputs/issue-limit-api-mutations-count-input) and [pull requests](../pull-requests/inputs/pull-request-limit-api-mutations-count-input) to alter your repository on a reduced scope.

```yml {5-7} title=".github/workflows/stale.yml"
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-limit-api-queries-count: 30
  pull-request-limit-api-queries-count: 30
```

## Customize the behaviour {#customize-the-behaviour}

If the action was successful, you may wish now to configure it at your convenience.  
Follow the [next page](../all-inputs) to have access to all the inputs.

:::info

The stale processing can be completely different between issues and pull requests.
