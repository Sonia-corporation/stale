### Input {#input}

Name: `issue-stale-label`  
Type: `string`  
Default value: `stale`

### Description {#description}

This option will let you define the label (by name) that will be added to your issues when they are considered as stale.

If the label is added to an issue (based on the [days before stale option](issue-days-before-stale-option)), the next time the issue is processed, the workflow will process it as a candidate for un-stale.  
If the issue was updated after the addition of the label, the issue will be un-stale, and the label will be removed.

Once the un-stale processing is done, if the issue is still stale, the workflow will then process it as a candidate for closing.  
If the issue is stale for too long (based on the [days before close option](issue-days-before-close-option)), the issue will be closed.

:::caution

The label must be a real label, existing inside your repository list of labels (_github.com/your-organization/your-repository/labels_).  
If not, the GitHub API will throw an error.
