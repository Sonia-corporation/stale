### Input {#input}

Name: `issue-ignore-any-assignees`  
Type: `string[]`  
Default value: `[]`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you ignore the processing of the issues which have at least one of the assignee from this list.  
This can be useful when you use assignees to assign the issues to some members of your repository which will for sure close or at least process the issues very soon.

### Example {#example}

```yml {6-8}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-ignore-any-assignees: |
    C0ZEN
    maintainers
```
