### Input {#input}

Type: `boolean`  
Default value: `true`

### Description {#description}

This can be useful only if you do not intend to use this action to process the issues to avoid calling the GitHub API and consuming your quotas for nothing.

```yml {6}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-processing: false
```
