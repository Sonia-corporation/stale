### Input {#input}

Name: `issue-ignore-all-projects`  
Type: `boolean`  
Default value: `false`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you ignore the processing of the issues which have at least one project.  
This can be useful when you link your issues with your projects, and you know that you will for sure close or at least process the issues very soon.

However, if you are not certain that linking the issues with any project will result in the handling for sure of the processing of the issues, this input may not suit you.  
You may prefer to use instead the [ignore any projects input](issue-ignore-any-projects-input) to list only some specific projects or not use this input at all.

### Example {#example}

```yml {6}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-ignore-all-projects: true
```
