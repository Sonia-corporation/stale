### Input {#input}

Name: `issue-stale-comment`  
Type: `string`  
Default value: `''`

### Description {#description}

This input will let you define the comment that will be added on the issues when they are stale during the processing.
This can be useful if you wish to improve the call to action so that watchers can be aware that their issues may be closed soon.

### Example {#example}

```yml {6-7}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-stale-comment: |
    This issue is now stale due to a lack of activity!
```
