### Input {#input}

Name: `issue-limit-api-queries-count`  
Type: `number`  
Default value: `-1` (unlimited)

### Description {#description}

This input will let you define a limit count of issues API queries (read) calls performed during the processing.  
If the limit is reached, the ongoing processed issue will finish it's processing then all other issues will be ignored.  
This can be useful when you want to play it safe with this action.  
This can be also very useful if you have a lot of issues to process, and you want to limit the quotas of your associated [GitHub token](../../github-token-input).

:::info

When the value is below `0`, the input will have no effect.

:::

### Cache {#cache}

Some queries are cached during the workflow when loading static resources like the labels.  
This will reduce the number of calls made to the GitHub API, which will also reduce the quotas consumed for your GitHub token.

### Example {#example}

```yml {6}
# ...
name: Stale
id: stale
uses: sonia-corporation/stale@latest
with:
  issue-limit-api-queries-count: 100
```
