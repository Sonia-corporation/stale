The brand-new UI of the stale action is here, changing the name and the colour palette!

<!--truncate-->

## Re-branding {#re-branding}

In order to keep consistency with the other projects inside the [Sonia corporation organization](https://github.com/Sonia-corporation?type=source), the action name was changed in some places to reflect that it's a "Sonia thing".  
The logo was changed from a thermostat to just the usual Sonia logo.

## Colour palette {#colour-palette}

The previous colour palette was a cold blue, to reflect the "stale" state of the items.  
Now, everything is pink, to follow the dress colour inside the Sonia's logo.

We hope you like, and if not, blame Sonia. :wink:
