It was time to say goodbye to the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) and embrace instead [Vercel](https://vercel.com).  
The documentation is now accessible from this [URL](https://sonia-stale-action.vercel.app).

## Why? {#why}

The documentation was not easily testable on a Pull Request.  
With [Vercel](https://vercel.com), each GitHub branch will have a dedicated documentation deployment.  
This will help us guarantee that it's always working as expected.

It will also be way faster for us to create a new release, because the documentation creation will be completely asynchronous.

On top of that, [Vercel](https://vercel.com) has many more features that we will also discover/configure later on.  
We also added [Sentry](https://sentry.io) as part of the documentation to track eventual errors that you may come across.

Even if we changed in all places the links from the [GitHub pages](https://sonia-corporation.github.io/stale/) to [Vercel](https://sonia-stale-action.vercel.app), we will continue to deploy the documentation there.  
We may create a redirection in the future though.
