  This will change how the ignoring process can be leverage to process only items that matters!

The first input of the inclusive filtering kind is out!

<!--truncate-->

## TL;DR {#tldr}

The input [issue-only-any-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-only-any-projects-input) is out!  
You can now only process your issues when they are linked to a project.

## A bit of context {#a-bit-of-context}

All the inputs added so far were useful to ignore all the items not having certain criteria.

For example, the only inputs available to ignore the processing of issues for a project were the [issue-ignore-all-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-ignore-all-projects-input) and the [issue-ignore-any-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-ignore-any-projects-input) inputs.  
But what if you only wish to process issues that belongs to a specific project?  
You simply couldn't!

Having inputs to reverse the logic to only process by using inclusive criteria was not something possible so far.

## What is new? {#what-is-new}

To tackle this issue and be able to only process issues that belongs to a specific project or to a specific list of projects, we needed a new input.  
So, the input [issue-only-any-projects](../docs/issues/inputs/issue-only-any-projects-input) was created for this purpose.

## Why is that so important? {#why-is-that-so-important}

Developing those features are not that hard, but thinking about how to combine them all together in a way that makes sense is a bit more difficult.  
But now we have a recipe to _inclusive inputs_, and we will be able to provide more functionalities following the same scheme! :rocket:

You can see an [advanced example](../docs/examples/multiple-cron-example) to configure different workflows with multiple cron that may help you fine-tune even more the action.
